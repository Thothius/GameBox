# GameBox

## Introduction
GameBox is a browser based platform for multiplayer games and hosts a number of games that are meant for two or more players. The idea is to make modified versions of classic games and host them in one location, providing users with an easy to use interface to set up games to play with friends or other users. Registered users will get to see statistics about their performance and competitive users can climb the ranking steps and be on the TOP lists.

Runs on a **Node.js server**, uses **Socket.io** for communication, **MongoDB** for data storage, **JQuery** for interactivity and  **Paper.js** for animations.
